                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>After a long run around chasing diffrent jobs I decided to settle down and work with one of my passions. I have loved computers since I took apart the family PC at age 10 and put it back together.</p>
                <p>I chose to begin my career with Thinkful and I'm excited for this first step in the next chapter of my life with a fantastic team of like minded individuals!</p>
                <p>Please reach out to me if you have any questions or if would like to get in touch. My skills might be rough but my drive is solid and I am always looking to refine my craft</p>
